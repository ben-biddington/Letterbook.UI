## Troubleshooting

### Problems with eslint

Sometimes you get errors due to caching. For example, I installed `express` once, ran `make` but then reverted the `express` install.

I kept getting this even after revert.

```
$ eslint . --ext=.js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx --cache --report-unused-disable-directives

/home/ben/sauce/Letterbook.UI/streaming/index.js
  8:17  error  '@types/express' should be listed in the project's dependencies, not devDependencies  import/no-extraneous-dependencies

âœ– 1 problem (1 error, 0 warnings)

```

Solution is to try and delete `.eslintcache`
